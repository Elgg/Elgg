Elgg version 0.8 IIS installation instructions

Some users have had success installing on Microsoft IIS web servers. While
this appears to work as normal, it is worth noting that it remains untested
by the core Elgg team and should be approached with caution.

IIS Mod-Rewrite is required. This can be obtained from:

Once this is installed, follow the instructions in INSTALL as normal. However,
when you copy htaccess-dist to .htaccess, open this file in a text editor and
remove all lines that don't start with RewriteEngine or RewriteRule.

Thanks to the Elgg.org community for testing this functionality.
