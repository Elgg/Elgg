/**
 * Elgg upgrade script.
 *
 * This script triggers any necessary upgrades. If the site has been upgraded
 * to the most recent version of the code, no upgrades are run and the caches
 * are flushed. If you would prefer that this script is not accessible to others
 * after an upgrade, you can delete it. Future versions of Elgg will include a
 * new version of the script. Deleting the script is not a requirement and
 * leaving it behind does not affect the security of the site.
 *
 * Upgrades use a table {db_prefix}upgrade_lock as a mutex to prevent concurrent upgrades.
 *
 * The URL to forward to after upgrades are complete can be specified by setting $_GET['forward']
 * to a relative URL.
