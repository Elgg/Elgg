Elgg version 0.9 upgrade instructions

Elgg 0.9 marks some changes in the file structure and initial setup. For a first 
time installation all should work well via the installer which will guide you 
through the process. Users upgrading their installation from 0.8.* should take care 
since the main configuration file (config.php) and .htacces will get overwritten. 
Make sure to make the appropriate backups.

PLEASE NOTE: Elgg 0.9 contains integration with the Explode service at
http://ex.plode.us/. From time to time, Elgg will ping Explode to let it know
it exists. If you don't want this to happen, you must delete the folder at
/mod/explodeping.
