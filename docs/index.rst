Elgg_ (:download:`pronunciation <_elgg_files/How_to_say_Elgg.mp3>`) is a rapid development framework with built-in social features.
It is a great fit for building any app where users log in and share information.

It has been used to build `all kinds of social apps`__:

 * private intranets
 * dating

There is also a `demo site`_ running a standard installation of Elgg.
