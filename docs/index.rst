############################

Elgg_ (`pronunciation`__) is a rapid development framework with built-in social features.
It is a great fit for building any app where users log in and share information.

It has been used to build `all kinds of social apps`__:

__ http://community.elgg.org/showcase

 * open networks (similar to Facebook)
 * topical (like the Elgg Community)
 * private intranets
 * dating
 * educational
 * company blog
 * etc.

There is also a `demo site`_ running a standard installation of Elgg.

This is the canonical documentation for the Elgg_ project.
This aims to replace the wiki_, which is out-of-date in many areas.
