   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

This is the canonical developer documentation for the
`Elgg <http://elgg.org/>`_ project.

This aims to replace the `wiki <http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_,
which is out-of-date in many areas, but may still be of use to you.
