CKEditor
========

With this plugin enabled the longtext input fields will get a WYSIWYG editor which allows for some additional markup options for your text.

Depending on the configuration the editor can be enriched with various text style markup options. 
Have a look at the CKEditor website for a full featured editor.

Images
------
Elgg also supports uploading images in the editor. 
You can upload images using a file dialog or just drag/drop or copy/paste the image into the editor.

Mentions
--------
With the CKEditor plugin you also enable mention capabilities. By default you can mention:

- Users: use `@` to start autocompleting users
- Groups: use `!` to start autocompleting groups
- Searchable content: use `[` to start autocompleting content

When you select something from the autocomplete list a link to the selected user/group/content will be added to the content. 
Based on the mentioned users preference they will also be notified they have been mentioned.

Toolbar configuration
---------------------
This plugin provides a standard toolbar configuration for the default and simple editor. 
The plugin settings allow you to configure a custom toolbar config.
Almost all ckeditor plugins are available for use.
