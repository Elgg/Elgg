Blog
====

A weblog, or blog, is arguably one of the fundamental DNA pieces of most types of social networking site. The simplest form of personal publishing, it allows for text-based notes to be published in reverse-chronological order. Commenting is also an important part of blogging, turning an individual act of publishing into a conversation.

Elgg's blog expands this model by providing per-entry access controls and cross-blog tagging. You can control exactly who can see each individual entry, as well as find other entries that people have written on similar topics. You can also see entries written by your friends (that you have access to).
