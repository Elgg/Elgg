"Elgg's initial funding was by a company called Curverider Ltd, which was "
"started by David Tosh and Ben Werdmuller. In 2010, Curverider was acquired "
"by Thematic Networks and control of the open-source project was turned over "
"to `The Elgg Foundation`_. Today, Elgg is a community-driven open source "
"project and has a variety of contributors and sponsors."

"release. That said, the API in release candidates is considered stable, so "
"once a release candidate is made available, you should feel comfortable "
