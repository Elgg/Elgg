msgid "An action in Elgg is the code that runs to make changes to the database when a user does something. For example, logging in, posting a comment, and making a blog post are actions.

#: ../../design/actions.rst:17
msgid "Actions are registered during the boot process by calling ``elgg_register_action()``. All actions URLs start with ``action/`` and are served by Elgg's front end controller through the action service. This approach is different from traditional PHP applications that send information to a specific file. The action service performs :doc:`CSRF security checks </design/security>`, and calls the registered action script file, then optionally forwards the user to a new page. By using the action service instead of a single script file, Elgg automatically provides increased security and extensibility."

msgid "AMD modules load asynchronously and execute as soon as their dependencies are available, so this eliminates the need to specify \"priority\" and \"location\" when registering JS libs in Elgg. Also, you don't need to worry about explicitly loading a module's dependencies in PHP. The AMD loader (RequireJS in this case) takes care of all that hassle for you. It's also possible have `text dependencies <http://requirejs.org/docs/api.html#text>`_ with the RequireJS text plugin, so client-side templating should be a breeze."

msgid "3. You do not need a build step to develop in AMD."
msgstr ""

#: ../../design/amd.rst:48
msgid "We like the edit-refresh cycle of web development. We wanted to make sure everyone developing in Elgg could continue experiencing that joy. Synchronous module formats like Closure or CommonJS just weren't an option for us. But even though AMD doesn't require a build step, *it is still very build-friendly*. Because of the ``define()`` wrapper, it's possible to concatenate multiple modules into a single file and ship them all at once in a production environment. [#]_"
