msgid "Actions are registered during the boot process by calling ``elgg_register_action()``. All actions URLs start with ``action/`` and are served by Elgg's front end controller through the action service. This approach is different from traditional PHP applications that send information to a specific file. The action service performs :doc:`CSRF security checks </design/security>`, and calls the registered action script file, then optionally forwards the user to a new page. By using the action service instead of a single script file, Elgg automatically provides increased security and extensibility."
