You need to expose a method for posting to the wire and you need to make sure that a user cannot post using someone else's account. Elgg provides a token-based approach for user authentication. It allows a user to submit their username and password in exchange for a token using the method ``auth.gettoken``. This token can then be used for some amount of time to authenticate all calls to the API before it expires by passing it as the parameter ``auth_token``. If you do not want to have your users trusting their passwords to 3rd-party applications, you can also extend the current capability to use an approach like OAuth."
