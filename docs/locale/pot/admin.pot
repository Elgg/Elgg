Each shared hosting provider prepends the account holder's name to the databases associated with that account. For example, the username for our primary host is ``userx`` so the host will prepend ``userx_`` to give us a database name of ``userx_elgg``. When we restore to our second shared hosting provider we're doing so with a username of ``usery`` so our database name will be ``usery_elgg``. The hosting providers don't allow you to modify this behavior. So the process here isn't as simple as just restoring the database from backup to the usery account. However, having said that, it's not terribly difficult either."
