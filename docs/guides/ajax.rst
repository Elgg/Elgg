Ajax
####

The ``elgg/Ajax`` AMD module (introduced in Elgg 2.1) provides a set of methods for communicating with the server in a concise and uniform way, which allows plugins to collaborate on the request data, the server response, and the returned client-side data.

Client and server code written for the legacy API should not need modification.

Overview
========

All the ajax methods perform the following:

#. Client-side, the ``data`` option (if given) is filtered by the hook ``ajax_request_data``.
#. The request is made to the server, either rendering a view or a form, calling an action, or loading a path.
#. Echoed JSON is turned into a response object (``Elgg\Services\AjaxResponse``).
#. The response object is filtered by the hook ``ajax_response``.
#. The response object is used to create the HTTP response.
#. Client-side, the response data is filtered by the hook ``ajax_response_data``.
#. The method returns a ``jqXHR`` object, which can be used as a Promise.

More notes:

* All hooks have a type depending on the method and first argument. See below.
* By default the ``elgg/spinner`` module is automatically used during requests.
* User messages generated by ``system_message()`` and ``register_error()`` are collected and displayed on the client.
* Elgg gives you a default error handler that shows a generic message if output fails.
* PHP exceptions or denied resource return HTTP error codes, resulting in use of the client-side error handler.
* The default HTTP method is ``POST`` for actions, otherwise ``GET``. You can set it via ``options.method``.
* For client caching, set ``options.method`` to ``"GET"`` and ``options.data.response_ttl`` to the max-age you want in seconds.

Performing actions
------------------

Consider this action:

.. code-block:: php

	// in myplugin/actions/do_math.php

	elgg_ajax_gatekeeper();

	$arg1 = (int)get_input('arg1');
	$arg2 = (int)get_input('arg2');

	// will be rendered client-side
	system_message('We did it!');

	echo json_encode([
		'sum' => $arg1 + $arg2,
		'product' => $arg1 * $arg2,
	]);

To execute it, use ``ajax.action('<action_name>', options)``:

.. code-block:: js

	var ajax = new require('elgg/Ajax')();

	ajax.action('do_math', {
		data: {
			arg1: 1,
			arg2: 2
		},
	}).done(function (output) {
		alert(output.sum);
		alert(output.product);
	});

Notes for actions:

* All hooks have type ``action:<action_name>``. So in this case, three hooks will be triggered:
   * client-side ``"ajax_request_data", "action:do_math"`` to filter the request data (before it's sent)
   * server-side ``"ajax_response", "action:do_math"`` to filter the response (after the action runs)
   * client-side ``"ajax_response_data", "action:do_math"`` to filter the response data (before the calling code receives it)
* CSRF tokens are added to the request data.
* The default method is ``POST``.
* Using ``forward()`` in and action simply sends the response. The URL given in not returned to the client.

Fetching data
-------------

Consider this PHP script that runs at ``http://example.org/myplugin_time``.

.. code-block:: php

	// in myplugin/start.php
	elgg_register_page_handler('myplugin_time', 'myplugin_get_time');

	function myplugin_get_time() {
		elgg_ajax_gatekeeper();

		echo json_encode([
			'rfc2822' => date(DATE_RFC2822),
			'day' => date('l'),
		]);

		return true;
	}

To fetch its output, use ``ajax.path('<url_path>', options)``.

.. code-block:: js

	var ajax = new require('elgg/Ajax')();

	ajax.path('myplugin_time').done(function (output) {
		alert(output.rfc2822);
		alert(output.day);
	});

Notes for paths:

* The 3 hooks (see Actions above) will have type ``path:<url_path>``. In this case, "path:myplugin_time".
* If the page handler echoes a regular web page, ``output`` will be a string containing the HTML.

Fetching views
--------------

Consider this view:

.. code-block:: php

	// in myplugin/views/default/myplugin/get_link.php

	if (empty($vars['entity']) || !$vars['entity'] instanceof ElggObject) {
		return;
	}

	$object = $vars['entity'];
	/* @var ElggObject $object */

	echo elgg_view('output/url', [
		'text' => $object->getDisplayName(),
		'href' => $object->getUrl(),
		'is_trusted' => true,
	]);

Since it's a PHP file, we must register it for Ajax first:

.. code-block:: php

	// in myplugin_init()
	elgg_register_ajax_view('myplugin/get_link');


To fetch the view, use ``ajax.view('<view_name>', options)``:

.. code-block:: js

	var ajax = new require('elgg/Ajax')();

	ajax.view('myplugin/get_link', {
		data: {
			guid: 123 // querystring
		},
	}).done(function (output) {
		$('.myplugin-link').html(output);
	});

Notes for views:

* The 3 hooks (see Actions above) will have type ``view:<view_name>``. In this case, "view:myplugin/get_link".
* ``output`` will be a string with the rendered view.
* The request data are injected into ``$vars`` in the view.
* If the request data contains ``guid``, the system sets ``$vars['entity']`` to the corresponding entity or ``false`` if it can't be loaded.

.. warning::

	In ajax views and forms, note that ``$vars`` can be populated by client input. The data is filtered like
	``get_input()``, but may not be the type you're expecting or may have unexpected keys.


Fetching forms
--------------

Consider we have a form view. We register it for Ajax:

.. code-block:: php

	// in myplugin_init()
	elgg_register_ajax_view('forms/myplugin/add');

To fetch this using ``ajax.form('<action_name>', options)``.

.. code-block:: js

	var ajax = new require('elgg/Ajax')();

	ajax.form('myplugin/add').done(function (output) {
		$('.myplugin-form-container').html(output);
	});

Notes for forms:

* The 3 hooks (see Actions above) will have type ``form:<action_name>``. In this case, "form:myplugin/add".
* ``output`` will be a string with the rendered view.
* The request data are injected into ``$vars`` in your form view.
* If the request data contains ``guid``, the system sets ``$vars['entity']`` to the corresponding entity or ``false`` if it can't be loaded.

.. note::

	Only the request data are passed to the requested form view (i.e. as a third parameter accepted by
	``elgg_view_form()``). If you need to pass attributes or parameters of the form element rendered by the
	``input/form`` view (i.e. normally passed as a second parameter to ``elgg_view_form()``), use the server-side
	hook ``view_vars, input/form``.

.. warning::

	In ajax views and forms, note that ``$vars`` can be populated by client input. The data is filtered like
	``get_input()``, but may not be the type you're expecting or may have unexpected keys.


Legacy elgg.ajax APIs
=====================

Elgg 1.8 introduced ``elgg.action``, ``elgg.get``, ``elgg.getJSON``, and other methods which behave less consistently both client-side and server-side.

Legacy elgg.action
------------------

Differences:

* you must manually pull the ``output`` from the returned wrapper
* the ``success`` handler will fire even if the action is prevented
* the ``success`` handler will receive a wrapper object. You must look for ``wrapper.output``
* no ajax hooks

.. code-block:: js

   elgg.action('do_math', {
     data: {
       arg1: 1,
       arg2: 2
     },
     success: function (wrapper) {
       if (wrapper.output) {
         alert(wrapper.output.sum);
         alert(wrapper.output.product);
       } else {
         // the system prevented the action from running, but we really don't
         // know why
         elgg.ajax.handleAjaxError();
       }
     }
   });


elgg.action notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 * It's best to echo a non-empty string, as this is easy to validate in the ``success`` function. If the action
   was not allowed to run for some reason, ``wrapper.output`` will be an empty string.
 * You may want to use the :doc:`elgg/spinner</guides/javascript>` module.
 * Elgg does not use ``wrapper.status`` for anything, but a call to ``register_error()`` causes it to be
   set to ``-1``.
 * If the action echoes a non-JSON string, ``wrapper.output`` will contain that string.
 * ``elgg.action`` is based on ``jQuery.ajax`` and returns a ``jqXHR`` object (like a Promise), if you should want to use it.
 * After the PHP action completes, other plugins can alter the wrapper via the plugin hook ``'output', 'ajax'``,
   which filters the wrapper as an array (not a JSON string).
 * A ``forward()`` call forces the action to be processed and output immediately, with the ``wrapper.forward_url``
   value set to the normalized location given.
 * To make sure Ajax actions can only be executed via XHR, use ``elgg_ajax_gatekeeper()``.

elgg.action JSON response wrapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code::

   {
     current_url: {String} "http://example.org/action/example/math", // not very useful
     forward_url: {String} "http://example.org/foo", ...if forward('foo') was called
     output: {String|Object} from echo in action
     status: {Number} 0 = success. -1 = an error was registered.
     system_messages: {Object}
   }

.. warning::

    It's probably best to rely only on the ``output`` key, and validate it in case the PHP action could not run
    for some reason, e.g. the user was logged out or a CSRF attack did not provide tokens.

.. warning::

    If ``forward()`` is used in response to a legacy ajax request (e.g. ``elgg.ajax``), Elgg will *always* respond
    with this wrapper, **even if not in an action**.

Legacy view fetching
--------------------

A plugin can use a view script to handle XHR ``GET`` requests. Here's a simple example of a view that returns a
link to an object given by its GUID:

.. code-block:: php

    // in myplugin_init()
    elgg_register_ajax_view('myplugin/get_link');

.. code-block:: php

    // in myplugin/views/default/myplugin/get_link.php

    if (empty($vars['entity']) || !$vars['entity'] instanceof ElggObject) {
        return;
    }

    $object = $vars['entity'];
    /* @var ElggObject $object */

    echo elgg_view('output/url', [
        'text' => $object->getDisplayName(),
        'href' => $object->getUrl(),
        'is_trusted' => true,
    ]);

.. code-block:: js

    elgg.get('ajax/view/myplugin/get_link', {
      data: {
        guid: 123 // querystring
      },
      success: function (output) {
        $('.myplugin-link').html(output);
      }
    });

The Ajax view system works significantly differently than the action system.

 * There are no access controls based on session status.
 * Non-XHR requests are automatically rejected.
 * GET vars are injected into ``$vars`` in the view.
 * If the request contains ``$_GET['guid']``, the system sets ``$vars['entity']`` to the corresponding entity or
   ``false`` if it can't be loaded.
 * There's no "wrapper" object placed around the view output.
 * System messages/errors shouldn't be used, as they don't display until the user loads another page.
 * Depending on the view's suffix (.js, .html, .css, etc.), a corresponding Content-Type header is added.

.. warning::

    In ajax views and forms, note that ``$vars`` can be populated by client input. The data is filtered like
	``get_input()``, but may not be the type you're expecting or may have unexpected keys.

Returning JSON from a view
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the view outputs encoded JSON, you must use ``elgg.getJSON`` to fetch it (or use some other method to set jQuery's
ajax option ``dataType`` to ``json``). Your ``success`` function will be passed the decoded Object.

Here's an example of fetching a view that returns a JSON-encoded array of times:

.. code-block:: js

    elgg.getJSON('ajax/view/myplugin/get_times', {
      success: function (data) {
        alert('The time is ' + data.friendly_time);
      }
    });

Legacy form fetching
--------------------

If you register a form view (name starting with ``forms/``), you can fetch it pre-rendered with ``elgg_view_form()``.
Simply use ``ajax/form/<action>`` (instead of ``ajax/view/<view_name>``):

.. code-block:: php

    // in myplugin_init()
    elgg_register_ajax_view('forms/myplugin/add');

.. code-block:: js

    elgg.get('ajax/form/myplugin/add', {
      success: function (output) {
        $('.myplugin-form-container').html(output);
      }
    });

Only the request data are passed to the requested form view (i.e. as a third parameter accepted by
``elgg_view_form()``). If you need to pass attributes or parameters of the form element rendered by the
``input/form`` view (i.e. normally passed as a second parameter to ``elgg_view_form()``), use the server-side
hook ``view_vars, input/form``.

.. warning::

    In ajax views and forms, note that ``$vars`` can be populated by client input. The data is filtered like
	``get_input()``, but may not be the type you're expecting or may have unexpected keys.


Legacy helper functions
-----------------------

These functions extend jQuery's native Ajax features.

``elgg.get()`` is a wrapper for jQuery's ``$.ajax()``, but forces ``GET`` and does URL normalization.

.. code-block:: js

   // normalizes the url to the current <site_url>/activity
   elgg.get('/activity', {
      success: function(resultText, success, xhr) {
         console.log(resultText);
      }
   });

``elgg.post()`` is a wrapper for jQuery's ``$.ajax()``, but forces ``POST`` and does URL normalization.
