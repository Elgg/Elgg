System events
=============

**boot, system**
    First event triggered. Triggered before plugins have been loaded.

**plugins_boot, system**
    Triggered just after the plugins are loaded. Rarely used. init, system is used instead.

**init, system**
    Plugins tend to use this event for initialization (extending views, registering callbacks, etc.)

**ready, system**
	Triggered after the ``init, system`` event. All plugins are fully loaded and the engine is ready
	to serve pages.

**pagesetup, system**
    Called just before the first content is produced. Is triggered by ``elgg_view()``.

**shutdown, system**
    Triggered after the page has been sent to the user. Expensive operations could be done here
    and not make the user wait.

.. note:: Depending upon your server configuration the PHP output
    might not be shown until after the process is completed. This means that any long-running
    processes will still delay the page load.

**log, systemlog**
	Called for all triggered events. Used internally by ``system_log_default_logger()`` to populate
	the ``system_log`` table.

**upgrade, system**
	Triggered after a system upgrade has finished. All upgrade scripts have run, but the caches 
	are not cleared.

on the same action. For example, ``update, object`` is thrown twice.
