File uploads
------------

If your plugin is using a snippet copied from the ``file/upload`` action to fix detected mime types for Microsoft zipped formats, it can now be safely removed.

If your upload action performs other manipulations on detected mime and simple types, it is recommended to make use of available plugin hooks:

- ``'mime_type','file'`` for filtering detected mime types
- ``'simple_type','file'`` for filtering parsed simple types
