Composer
--------

PHP Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The minimal PHP version is now 8.3.

PHPUnit
~~~~~~~

Elgg now uses PHPUnit 12.5. You might need to update your tests.

Elgg core changes
-----------------

Default config changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The trash is now enabled by default
* The config option ``css_compiler_options`` has been removed

Cron
~~~~

The PHP max execution time during the CRON execution has been set to 'unlimited'. So for developers there is no longer a
need to call ``set_time_limit(0);``

CSS Crush has been removed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CSS files are no longer preprocessed by CSS Crush. CSS Crush is no longer maintained and various features are now part
of regular CSS (like nesting and the usage of variables). 
Variables set in your ``elgg-plugin.php`` (or those available in core) are still available in CSS files but you will
need to update your CSS to use ``var(--elgg-your-variable)``. If you have a custom theme you will need to check all
your CSS files for CSS Crush features and update your code accordingly. The ``vars:compiler, css`` event has been removed.

.. note::

	The variables for the ``walled garden`` and ``maintenance`` page background images have been changed. The variables
	used for media queries have been removed and will need to be hardcoded in your css files.

Entity restore
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``entity/chooserestoredestination`` form and action now use a singular parameter value for the
``destination_container_guid`` when selecting a different entity to restore to.

Entity listings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The behaviour of ``elgg_list_entities()`` has been changed. The default value for the ``limit`` parameter which can be
provided by the query parameter ``limit`` (eg. ``/blog/all?limit=20``) has been limited to a minimum of 1 and a maximum
of 100.

Plugin changes
--------------

Group route definitions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the group route definition we've dropped the ``subpage`` variable for the following routes:

- ``collection:object:blog:group``
- ``collection:object:bookmarks:group``
- ``collection:object:page:group``

This could break user favorites to those pages.

Groups
~~~~~~

The ``group/edit`` form and action now use a singular parameter value for the ``owner_guid`` when selecting a
different group owner.

Likes
~~~~~

By default only content owners can see who likes their content. This can be made public by a new plugin setting.

Members
~~~~~~~

The names of some routes have been changed to align with the route naming suggestions

- ``collection:user:user`` was changed to ``collection:user:user:all``
- ``search:user:user`` was changed to ``collection:user:user:search``

Inline with the route name changes some language keys have been renamed.

Messages
~~~~~~~~

The ``messages/send`` form and action parameter ``recipients`` has been renamed to ``recipient`` and now contains a
singular value when selecting a recipient.

Profile
~~~~~~~

The profile field `Twitter` has been removed.

Webservices
~~~~~~~~~~~

The responses from the REST API calls now have a ``Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="result.<view>"`` header.

Changes in functions
--------------------

Changed function return types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``elgg_register_external_file()`` now returns void
* ``elgg_register_pam_handler()`` now returns void
* ``elgg_register_route()`` now returns void
* ``elgg_unregister_external_file()`` now returns void
* ``elgg_unregister_menu_item()`` now returns void

Changed class function return types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* ``\Elgg\Traits\Di\ServiceFacade`` now returns a ``string``
