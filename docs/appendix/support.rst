Support policy
==============

As of Elgg 1.9, each minor release gets:
 * Normal bugfixes every 2 weeks for 3 months, at which point the next minor release candidate is made available.
 * Security and critical (i.e. regression) bug fixes for 1 year from the date of the next stable minor release. These will be released on an as-needed basis.

We don't have a support policy for major releases (x.0.0) yet because we've never done one.
