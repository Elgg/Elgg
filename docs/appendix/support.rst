Support policy
==============

As of Elgg 2.0, each minor release receives bug and security fixes only until the next minor release.

Long Term Support Releases
--------------------------

Within each major version, the last minor release is designated for long term support ("LTS") and will
receive bug fixes until the 2nd following major version release, and security fixes until the 3rd
following major version release.

E.g. 1.12 is the last minor release within 1.x. It will receive bug fixes until 3.0 is released and
security fixes until 4.0 is released.

When bugs are found, a good faith effort will be made to patch the LTS release, but **not all fixes
will be back-ported.** E.g. some fixes may depend on new APIs, break backwards compatibility, or require
significant refactoring. If a fix risks stability of the LTS branch, it will not be included.
