- **Composer** is the package manager of choice that greatly simplifes installation and maintenance of Elgg core and plugins
- **Flexible system of hooks and events** that allows plugins to extend and modify most aspects of application's functionality and behavior

- **Flexible entity system** that allows applications to prototype new types of content and user interactions
-  **Opinionated data model** with a consolidated API layer that allows the developers to easily interface with the database
- **Access control system** that allows applications to build granular content access policies, as well as create private networks and intranets
- **Groups** - out of the box support for user groups
- **File storage** powered by flexible API that allows plugins to store user-generated files and serve/stream them without booting the engine
- **Notifications service** that allows applications to subscribe users to on-site and email notifications and implement integrations with other their-party services
- **RPC web services** that can be used for complex integrations with external applications and mobile clients
- **Internationalization** and localization of Elgg applications is simple and can be integrated with third-party services such as Transifex
- **Elgg community** that can help with any arising issues and hosts a repository of **1000+ open source plugins**
