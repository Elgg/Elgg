Lazy Hover
=============
Lazy loads the Elgg user hover menu. 

By not preloading all of the user drop down menus there is less server time needed to render a page. 
The more icons you have on your page, the more you will see the performance increase. 
There is also collateral benefits in page download size and DOM processing.
