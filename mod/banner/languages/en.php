			I'd rather die vicious and happy to live clean and boring. I prefer to find a star in the mud to four diamonds on glass. I'd rather burn the star, is fire, exuding a touch of coldness. I'd rather kiss the ground twenty times hard to reach once at the top to climb gradually, without ever falling but never reaching the top. Prefer it pains me that I transferred, it hurt me to ignore me. Rather feel. Prefer a dark and beautiful, dirty and beautiful, a lot of clear days do not tell me anything. Prefer a string to a muzzle. I'd rather stay in bed all day thinking about my life me up to think of others. Prefer a cat to a dog. Because the cat will spider, is unfaithful, ignores you, gets away, but you know that, despite everything, I could not live without you. Instead, the dog is stupid, he knows nothing, absurdly obeys you. Women prefer women cat dog, for the same reasons. I prefer the sea to the mountains. Life is a night lying on the beach, watching the stars without seeing them, daydreaming, letting the brew sand between my toes, all drunk. And at night, always at night. Never sunlight. The night is magical. It makes me live, not to think. I set in motion. Snap my schemes. I prefer the cool summer nights, walking with little clothes, sit on the floor and get me some life in the body. I know Morning headache. I get sleepy. I removed the desire to speak. It reminds me that I am mortal. It reminds me that I'm normal. The night makes me unique. Prefer experience things, although I do wrong. Although my blood boil. Prefer try everything to die without knowing what I like. And, more than anything, I prefer life giving candy kisses and gentle caress of her warm skin. <b>Daniel Valdés</b>");
