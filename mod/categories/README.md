Site-wide Categories
====================

If you're not a programmer, don't worry! All the main Elgg tools
are already adapted to use categories, and a growing number of
third party Elgg tools use it too.

This plugin uses views and events hooks to allow you to easily add
site-wide categories across Elgg tools.

This is a two-line addition to any plugin.

In your edit/create form:

`echo elgg_view('input/categories', $vars);`

In your object view:

`echo elgg_view('output/categories', $vars);`
	
Note that in both cases, `$vars['entity']` MUST be populated with
the entity the categories apply to, if it exists.
