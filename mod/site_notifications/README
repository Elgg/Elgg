Site Notifications
====================
In Elgg 1.5-1.8, site notifications were provided by the message plugin. In Elgg
1.9 they were moved to a separate plugin.

Because site notifications can result in a lot of writes to the database to create
a notification per recipient (as opposed to email notifications), they may not
scale well for large sites or sites that have large groups.
