Description:

phpThumb() uses the GD library to create thumbnails from
images (GIF, PNG or JPEG) on the fly. The output size is
configurable (can be larger or smaller than the source),
and the source may be the entire image or only a portion
of the original image. True color and resampling is used
if GD v2.0+ is available, otherwise low-color and simple
resizing is used. Source image can be a physical file on
the server or can be retrieved from a database. GIFs are
supported on all versions of GD even if GD does not have
native GIF support thanks to the GIFutil class by Fabien
Ezber. AntiHotlinking feature prevents other people from
using your server to resize their thumbnails, or link to
your  images  from  another  server.  The  cache feature
reduces server load. Images can be


Usage:

Call phpThumb() just like you would a normal image.
Examples:
 <IMG SRC="phpThumb.php?src=/image.jpg&w=100">
 <IMG SRC="phpThumb.php?src=http://example.com/foo.jpg">
See the "demo" link on http://phpthumb.sourceforge.net
for more usage examples). Parameters that can be passed
are listed below under "URL Parameters".

NOTE: It's recommended you use the local image filename
wherever possible (rather than http://) because performance
is much better, less (or no) use of temp files, and the
last-modified check for cached files doesn't work for
remote files.

To access files over a LAN with Windows share names you
must use the network name (or IP) and not a mapped drive
name, for example:
  //othercomputer/file.jpg - good
  //192.168.2.1/file.jpg - good
  z:/file.jpg - won't work
This is a PHP limitation (see www.php.net/file-exists)
Note: you may want to use "/" slashes instead of "\" if
you have magic_quotes_gpc enabled to avoid stripslashes
problems, although either slash should work if
magic_quotes_gpc is disabled


Configuration:

There are some configuration options you may (but are
not required to) change. Most configuration options can
be set when you call phpThumb() - see list below), but
default configuration options (such as cache directory)
are in phpThumb.config.php - this is the only file you
should ever modify.

The configuration file is distributed as
phpThumb.config.php.default to prevent accidental
overwriting of old configuration settings. Please
migrate your old settings to the new file (if upgrading),
delete your old config and rename the default to
phpThumb.config.php


The amount of memory required for phpThumb depends on
several factors: the dimensions of the source image,
the dimensions of the output image, whether unsharp
masking is applied, whether watermarks are applied, etc.
The auto-detection of memory limits works as a general
"safe" value. You may be able to exceed the auto value
by a small or large amount, depending on whether you
apply watermarks and/or sharpening, and the output size
of your thumbnails. I do not currently have a reliable
formula for calculating such things, but I will attempt
to craft one for future versions of phpThumb(). Until
then, set "max_source_pixels" in phpThumb.config.php to a
value that works well for you (or leave it alone if the
defaults give you no problems).

The configuration options you should maybe modify are:
* cache_directory - thumbnailing is slow and processor-
    intensive. Enabling caching will dramatically speed
    up future thumbnail serving
* max_source_pixels - This should be auto-detected, but
    if auto-detection fails and you get an invalid image
    from large source images, set this to about 20% of
    your available PHP memory limit.
* imagemagick_path - If the source image is larger than
    max_source_pixels allows, but ImageMagick is available
    phpThumb() will use it to generate the thumbnail.


Calling as an object (not using phpThumb.php):

To use a database rather than physical files, or to
render output to a file instead of the browser, you
should skip phpThumb.php and instantiate your own
phpThumb() object as follows:

  // create new phpThumb() object
  require_once('phpthumb.class.php');
  $phpThumb = new phpThumb();

  // set data
  $phpThumb->setSourceFilename($image_filename);
  // or $phpThumb->setSourceData($binary_image_data);
  // or $phpThumb->setSourceImageResource($gd_image_resource);

  // set parameters (see "URL Parameters" below)
  $phpThumb->w = 100;

  // set options (see phpThumb.config.php)
  // here you must preface each option with "config_"
  $phpThumb->config_output_format = 'jpeg';

  // Set error handling (optional)
  $phpThumb->config_error_die_on_error = false;

  // generate & output thumbnail
  if ($phpThumb->GenerateThumbnail()) {
    $phpThumb->OutputThumbnail();
    // or
    //if (!$phpThumb->RenderToFile($filename)) {
    //// do something with debug/error messages
    //echo 'Failed: '.implode("\n", $phpThumb->debugmessages);
    //}
  } else {
    // do something with debug/error messages
    echo 'Failed: '.implode("\n", $phpThumb->debugmessages);
  }


If you want to change any of the configuration parameters
(see phpThumb.config.php) you can change them like this:
    $phpThumb->config_<variable_name> = <value>
for example:
    $phpThumb->config_output_format = 'jpeg';

Note: If you want to loop through and create multiple
  thumbnails from different image sources, you should
  create and dispose an instance of phpThumb() each time
  through the loop and not reuse the object.

Note: phpThumb.php is where the caching code is located, if
  you instantiate your own phpThumb() object that code is
  bypassed and it's up to you to handle the reading and
  writing of cached files.

Note: High-Security mode is recommended enabled if possible.
  Set $PHPTHUMB_CONFIG['high_security_enabled'] in
  phpThumb.config.php to enable it. Each call to phpThumb
  needs to be made through the function supplied at the
  bottom of phpThumb.config.php which create the hash:
    require_once('phpThumb.config.php');
    echo '<img src="'.phpThumbURL('src=pic.jpg&w=50').'">';


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

URL Parameters:
 src = filename of source image
 new = create new image, not thumbnail of existing image.
       Requires "w" and "h" parameters set.
       [ex: &new=FF0000|75] - red background, 75% opacity
       Set to hex color string of background. Opacity is
       optional (defaults to 100% opaque).
   w = max width of output thumbnail in pixels
   h = max height of output thumbnail in pixels
   f = output image format ("jpeg", "png", or "gif")
   q = JPEG compression (1=worst, 95=best, 75=default)
  sx = left side of source rectangle (default = 0)
       (values 0 < sx < 1 represent percentage)
  sy = top side of source rectangle (default = 0)
       (values 0 < sy < 1 represent percentage)
  sw = width of source rectangle (default = fullwidth)
       (values 0 < sw < 1 represent percentage)
  sh = height of source rectangle (default = fullheight)
       (values 0 < sh < 1 represent percentage)
  zc = zoom-crop. Will auto-crop off the larger dimension
       so that the image will fill the smaller dimension
       (requires both "w" and "h"). Set "zc=1" to enable.
       (overrides both "iar" and "far")
  bg = background hex color (default = FFFFFF)
 bgt = background color is transparent (default = 0)
       use with brx/bry, set to 1 for transparency,
       set bgt=256 for IE-compatible 256-color mode
  bc = border hex color (default = 000000)
fltr = filter system. Call as an array as follows:
       - "gam" (Gamma Correction) [ex: &fltr[]=gam|<value>]
         where <value> can be a number >0 to 10+ (default 1.0)
         Must be >0 (zero gives no effect). There is no max,
         although beyond 10 is pretty useless. Negative
         numbers actually do something, maybe not quite the
         desired effect, but interesting nonetheless.
       - "ds" (DeSaturate) [ex: &fltr[]=ds|<value>]
         where <value> is a number between zero (no change)
         and 100 (complete desaturation -- grayscale), or it
         can be a negative number for saturation boost.
       - "gray" (Grayscale) [ex: &fltr[]=gray]
         this is an alias for 100% desaturation
       - "clr" (Colorize) [ex: &fltr[]=clr|<value>|<color>]
         where <value> is a number between 0 and 100 for the
         amount of colorization, and <color> is the hex color
         to colorize to.
       - "sep" (Sepia) [ex: &fltr[]=sep|<value>|<color>]
         where <value> is a number between 0 and 100 for the
         amount of colorization (default=50), and <color> is
         the hex color to colorize to (default=A28065).
       - "usm" (UnSharpMask) [ex: &fltr[]=usm|<a>|<r>|<t>]
         where <a> is the amount (default = 80), <r> is the
         radius (default = 0.5), <t> is the threshold
         (default = 3).
       - "blur" (Blur) [ex: &fltr[]=blur|<radius>]
         where (0 < <radius> < 25) (default = 1)
       - "lvl" (Levels) [ex: &fltr[]=lvl|<channel>|<min>|<max>
         where <channel> can be one of 'r', 'g', 'b', 'a' (for
         Red, Green, Blue, Alpha respectively), or '*' for all
         channels based on average grayscale value (default).
         <min> and <max> are the clip points for the levels
         and are set to clip 0.1% of each end by default.
         (range = 0-255) and are set to clip 0.1% of each end
         by default. Use -1 for min and/or max to invoke auto-
         detect mode. Using default parameters (&fltr[]=lvl)
         is similar to Auto Contrast in Adobe Photoshop.
       - "hist" (Histogram)
         [ex: &fltr[]=hist|<b>|<c>|<w>|<h>|<a>|<o>|<m>]
         Where <b> is the color band(s) to display, from back
         to front (one or more of "rgba*" for Red Green Blue
         Alpha and Grayscale respectively);
         <c> is a semicolon-seperated list of hex colors to
         use for each graph band (defaults to FF0000, 00FF00,
         0000FF, 999999, FFFFFF respectively);
         <w> and <h> are the width and height of the overlaid
         histogram in pixels, or if <= 1 then percentage of
         source image width/height;
         <a> is the alignment (same as for "wmi" and "wmt");
         <o> is opacity from 0 to 100;
         <m> is the edge (and inter-tile) margin in percent
       - "over" (OVERlay/underlay image) overlays an image on
         the thumbnail, or overlays the thumbnail on another
         image (to create a picture frame for example)
         [ex: &fltr[]=over|<i>|<u>|<m>|<o>]
         where <i> is the image filename; <u> is "0" (default)
         for overlay the image on top of the thumbnail or "1"
         for overlay the thumbnail on top of the image; <m> is
         the margin - can be absolute pixels, or if < 1 is a
         percentage of the thumbnail size (default is 0 for
         overlay and 10% for underlay); <o> is opacity (0 =
         transparent, 100 = opaque)
         (thanks raynerapeÿgmail*com, shabazz3ÿmsu*edu)
       - "wmi" (WaterMarkImage)
         [ex: &fltr[]=wmi|<f>|<a>|<o>|<m>] where <f> is the
         filename of the image to overlay, <a> is the
         alignment (one of BR, BL, TR, TL, C, R, L, T, B, *
         where B=bottom, T=top, L=left, R=right, C=centre,
         *=tile), <o> is opacity from 0 to 100, <m> is the
         edge (and inter-tile) margin in percent
       - "wmt" (WaterMarkText)
         [ex: &fltr[]=wmt|<t>|<s>|<a>|<c>|<f>|<o>|<m>|<n>]
         where:
         <t> is the text to use as a watermark,
         <s> is the font size (1-5 for built-in font, or point
           size for TrueType fonts),
         <a> is the alignment (one of BR, BL, TR, TL, C, R, L,
           T, B, * where B=bottom, T=top, L=left, R=right,
           C=centre, *=tile),
         <c> is the hex color of the text
         <f> is the filename of the TTF file (optional, if
           omitted a built-in font will be used)
         <o> is opacity from 0 to 100,
         <m> is the edge (and inter-tile) margin in percent
         <n> is the angle
         (thanks mailÿmmjaeger*com)
       - "flip" [ex: &fltr[]=flip|x   or   &fltr[]=flip|y]
         flip image on X or Y axis
       - "elip" [ex: &fltr[]=elip]
         similar to rounded corners but more extreme
       - "mask" [ex: &fltr[]=mask|filename.png]
         greyscale values of mask are applied as the alpha
         channel to the main image. White is opaque, black
         is transparent.
       - "bvl" (BeVeL) [ex: &fltr[]=bvl|<w>|<c1>|<c2>]
         where <w> is the bevel width, <c1> is the hex color
         for the top and left shading, <c2> is the hex color
         for the bottom and right shading
       - "bord" (BORDer) [ex: &fltr[]=bord|<w>|<rx>|<ry>|<c>
         where <w> is the width in pixels, <rx> and <ry> are
         horizontal and vertical radii for rounded corners,
         and <c> is the hex color of the border
       - "fram" (FRAMe) draws a frame, similar to "bord" but
         more configurable
         [ex: &fltr[]=fram|<w1>|<w2>|<c1>|<c2>|<c3>]
         where <w1> is the width of the main border, <w2> is
         the width of each side of the bevel part, <c1> is the
         hex color of the main border, <c2> is the highlight
         bevel color, <c3> is the shadow bevel color
       - "drop" (DROP shadow)
         [ex: &fltr[]=drop|<d>|<w>|<clr>|<a>]
         where <d> is distance from image to shadow, <w> is
         width of shadow fade (not yet implemented), <clr> is
         the hex color of the shadow, and <a> is the angle of
         the shadow (default=225)
file = if set then thumbnail will be rendered to this
       filename, not output and not cached. (Deprecated,
       recommended you instantiate your own object instead)
goto = URL to redirect to after rendering image to file
       * Must begin with "http://"
       * Requires file parameter set
       (Deprecated, recommended you instantiate your own
       object instead)
 err = custom error image filename instead of showing
       error messages (for use on production sites)
 xto = EXIF Thumbnail Only - set to only extract EXIF
       thumbnail and not do any additional processing
  ra = Rotate by Angle: angle of rotation in degrees
       positive = counterclockwise, negative = clockwise
  ar = Auto Rotate: set to "x" to use EXIF orientation
       stored by camera. Can also be set to "l" or "L"
       for landscape, or "p" or "P" for portrait. "l"
       and "P" rotate the image clockwise, "L" and "p"
       rotate the image counter-clockwise.
 aoe = Output Allow Enlarging - override the setting for
       $CONFIG['output_allow_enlarging'] (1=on, 0=off)
       ("far" and "iar" both override this and allow output
       larger than input)
 iar = Ignore Aspect Ratio - disable proportional resizing
       and stretch image to fit "h" & "w" (which must both
       be set).  (1=on, 0=off)  (overrides "far")
 far = Force Aspect Ratio - image will be created at size
       specified by "w" and "h" (which must both be set).
       (1=on, 0=off)
maxb = MAXimum Byte size - auto-set compression (JPEG) or
       bit depth (GIF & PNG) to fit thumbnail into "maxb"
       bytes of output image.
down = filename to save image to. If this is set the
       browser will prompt to save to this filename rather
       than display the image


Additional Object-only configuration variables:
  rawImageData = binary data of source image, for example
                 if the source data is from a database. Set
                 this value instead of setting "src".



General Notes:

* Always use the local image filename wherever possible
  rather than a full http:// URL because performance is
  much better, less (or no) use of temp files, and the
  last-modified check for cached files doesn't work for
  remote files.

* Thumbnails will be scaled proportionately to fit in a
  box of at most (width * height) pixels
  (unless "iar" is set)

* Thumbnail caching for URL or database sources requires
  an absolute directory name for $config_cache_directory
  Physical file cached thumbnails will be recreated if
  the source file changes, but remote/database files
  cannot (modification time isn't readily available)

* If you need a GUI interface for a user to specify crop
  settings you can investigate 12cropimage:
  http://one-two.net/12cropimage

* Cropping images can be specified with either exact pixel
  values for sx/sy/sw/sh parameters, or if those are set
  to a value >0 and <1 then these are interpreted as a
  percentage of the source image width/height. For example,
  to crop 25% off all sides, you would specify parameters:
  phpThumb.php?src=pic.jpg&sx=.25&sy=.25&sw=.5&sh=.5

* phpThumb() may have tempfile access issues on servers
  where Safe Mode is enabled, specificly when accessing
  a file over HTTP, or when a non-bundled version of GD
  is in use. Specifying "config_temp_directory" may help

* Mask forces output to 32-bit alpha PNG format. Various
  browsers display this inconsistantly.  See
  http://www.silisoftware.com/png_transparency/
  For alpha-channel PNG display in IE, see this page:
  http://www.koivi.com/ie-png-transparency/

* Properly resolving /~user/ style filenames requires
  apache_lookup_uri(), which is missing or broken in
  Apache2, or if PHP is not installed as an Apache module.
  phpThumb() does try and work around this if it is
  unavailble, but you may have to specify a full filename
  for "src" if you encounter problems.

* phpThumb() should work with PHP v4.0.6+, but seems to
   have a few quirks before v4.1.0
  EXIF thumbnail extraction requires PHP v4.2.0+
  Image rotation requires PHP v4.3.0+. There have been
    reports of problems with PHP older than v4.3.3

* phpThumb() works with GD v1.x, but works better with
   GD v2.0+ because of the true-color image support
   and ImageCopyResampled(). Also, there appears to be a
   bug in ImageCopyResized() which is used with GD v1.x
   where the bottom and/or right line of pixels is set
   to the background color (due to a rounding error?)
  NOTE: Please use the bundled version of GD if at all
   possible (with PHP v4.3.0+) because the non-bundled
   version has bugs which may cause PHP to crash:
   * http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=21518
   * http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=24174
   phpThumb() has a workaround for the above bug but
   there may be other bugs, and the workaround is slow.
  Most (if not all) filters require GD v2.x to function
   at all.
