Coopfunding Upgrade Instructions
=========================

Note: Upgrades are one way--You cannot downgrade once you run the upgrade 
      script. Always back up your database, code, and data directory
      before upgrading!

Upgrading to the latest release
-----------------------------------------

1. Back up your Coopfunding database, code, and data directory.

2. Download the latest version of Coopfunding from https://coopfunding.net/.

3. Upload and overwrite your existing Coopfunding files. Any modifications should
   have been written within plugins so that they are not lost. If this is
   not the case, take care to maintain your modifications. If you have
   modified core files, Coopfunding may not work correctly.

4. Copy htaccess_dist to .htaccess, replacing your existing version. Any 
   modifications to the original .htaccess should be moved to the new
   .htaccess file.

5. Visit http://your-coopfunding-site/upgrade.php
