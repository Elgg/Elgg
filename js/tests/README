Elgg JavaScript Unit Tests
--------------------------

Introduction
============
Elgg uses js-test-driver to run its unit tests. Instructions on obtaining,
configuring, and using it are at http://code.google.com/p/js-test-driver/. It
supports running the test in multiple browsers and debugging using web browser
based debuggers. Visit its wiki at the Google Code site for more information.


Sample Usage
============
 1. Put jar file in the base directory of Elgg
 2. Run the server: java -jar JsTestDriver-1.3.3d.jar --port 4224
 3. Point a web browser at http://localhost:4224
 4. Run the tests: java -jar JsTestDriver-1.3.3d.jar --config js/tests/jsTestDriver.conf --basePath . --tests all


Configuration Hints
===================
 * The port when running the server must be the same as listed in the 
   configuration file. If that port is being used, change the configuration file.
 * The basePath must be the base directory of Elgg.
