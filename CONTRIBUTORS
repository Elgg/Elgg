Elgg would not be possible without the people contributing to its
code.  The following people have made additions and changes to the
core release, and are listed in alphabetical order. This is not
necessarily a canonical list; contributors may email system@elgg.net 
in order to have contact details added or amended for the next
release. We apologise for any omissions which may have arisen.

It is important also to recognise the input of the Elgg development
community; details of this can be found at http://elgg.org/developers.php.
