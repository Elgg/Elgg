Version 1.8.0 (Jackie)
(September 5th, 2011 from git://github.com/Elgg/Elgg.git)

 Notes:
  Elgg 1.8 contains the most changes in Elgg since the transition from Elgg 
  0.9 to Elgg 1.0. The core team tried to make the transition as smooth as
  possible, but in the interest of following standards and simplifying the
  development process for core and third party developers, we have made
  changes that will require updating plugins. We believe these changes
  will help Elgg development be easier for everyone.

  It is unreasonable and unhelpful to list the full details of all changes in
  this file. Instead, we will list the high level, overarching changes to
  systems. If you are interested in the specifics, Elgg 1.8's source code is
  highly documented and serves as a good guide and the git commit log can
  provide excruciating details of what has changed between 1.7 and 1.8.

  Please post your feedback, questions, and comments to the community site
  at http://community.elgg.org. As always, thank you for using Elgg!

  --The Elgg Core Development Team

 A tip about updating plugins:
  It's not difficult to update 1.7 plugins for 1.8. There is a detailed 
  document outlining this process on the wiki:
  http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Updating_plugins_for_Elgg_1.8

  The basic process is:
  1. Clean up the plugin to make sure it conforms to coding standards,
     official structure, and best practices.
  2. Update any uses of deprecated functions. Functions deprecated in 1.7 will
     produce visible notices in 1.8!
  3. Use the new manifest format.
  4. Use the new menu functions.
  5. Use the new JS features.
  6. Update the views to use core CSS helper functions and classes instead of
     writing your own.

  The documentation directory and the wiki has more information.

 User-visible changes:
  * New default theme.
  * New installation.
  * Separate and updated admin interface.
  * Updated plugin themes.

 Generic API changes:
  * Improved the markup and CSS.
  * Restructured and simplified the views layouts.
  * Added a new menu system.
  * Added new CSS and JS file registration functions.
  * Added a JS engine.
  * Added a breadcrumb system.
  * Added a sticky forms system.

 New plugins:
  * Dashboard - The activity stream is now the default index page. A 1.7-style
    dashboard is provided through the dashboard plugin.
  * Developers Plugins - Developer tools.
  * Likes - Allows users to "like" other users' content.
  * oAuth API - A generic, reusable oAuth library.
  * Tag Cloud - A widget-based tag cloud generator.
  * Twitter API - A generic Twitter library that allows signin with Twitter
    and pushing content to tweets. Replaces twitter_service.

 Deprecated plugins:
  * captcha - Captchas have long since stopped being useful as a deterrent
    against spam.
  * crontrigger - Real cron should be used.
  * default_widgets - This functionality is now part of core.
  * friends - This functionality is now part of core.
  * riverdashboard - Displaying the river (activity stream) is default in
    core. The original dashboard can be restored by the new Dashboard plugin.
  * twitter_service - Replaced by Twitter API.

 Elgg 1.8.0.1 was released immediately after 1.8.0 to correct a problem in
 installation.
