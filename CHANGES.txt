Version 1.8.0 (Jackie)
(September 5th, 2011 from git://github.com/Elgg/Elgg.git)

 Notes:
  Elgg 1.8 contains the most changes in Elgg since the transition from Elgg 
  0.9 to Elgg 1.0. The core team tried to make the transition as smooth as
  possible, but in the interest of following standards and simplifying the
  development process for core and third party developers, we have made
  changes that will require updating plugins. We believe these changes
  will help Elgg development be easier for everyone.

  It is unreasonable and unhelpful to list the full details of all changes in
  this file. Instead, we will list the high level, overarching changes to
  systems. If you are interested in the specifics, Elgg 1.8's source code is
  highly documented and serves as a good guide and the git commit log can
  provide excruciating details of what has changed between 1.7 and 1.8.

  Please post your feedback, questions, and comments to the community site
  at http://community.elgg.org. As always, thank you for using Elgg!

  --The Elgg Core Development Team

 A tip about updating plugins:
  It's not difficult to update 1.7 plugins for 1.8. There is a detailed 
  document outlining this process on the wiki:
  http://docs.elgg.org/wiki/Updating_plugins_for_Elgg_1.8

  The basic process is:
  1. Clean up the plugin to make sure it conforms to coding standards,
     official structure, and best practices.
